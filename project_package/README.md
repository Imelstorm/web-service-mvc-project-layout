# `/project_package`

---

Main package of the project. Contains all application essential directories.

`/project_package` it's just a generic name. For Python, it is more typical to have it the same as the repository name but in `snake_case`.
For example, in this case, it should be `web_service_mvc_project_layout`.
Occasionally there are also cases when the name of the `project_packge` package could have a `src` name in Python.

In JavaScript, on the other hand, more typical to name it `/src`
