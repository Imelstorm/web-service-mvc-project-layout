# `/tests`

---

Project-related tests of different types. Different types of tests should be stored in separate sub-packages.

Even if you have only one type of test right now, it's better to store it in a separate folder. It will save your nerves during project growth and evolution.

It also can be extended with all tests necessary stuff like fixtures, stubs, mocks, generators, and other utils

* `/integration`
* `/functional`
* `/unit`
* `/fixtures`
* `/stubs`
* `/mocks`
* `/utils`
